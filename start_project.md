### How to prepare: 
Needs:  (What you should know (and share) by the time you start) 
- descriptive short name
- clear target 
- project’s type or orientation (is it for lambdaspace, personal, fun 
etc)
since a hacker space is all about cooperation, document everything about 
it.
- share suggested milestones

### How to make the first step and find people to help:
targets:
- share
- make it easy for someone to participate

How  (suggestions) :
- Talk to mattermost for the project tell the lambdaspace people what 
you want to do
- Make an event for the project, something like the first step of it.
- Make (or ask for help if needed for)  an event about teaching the 
technology/ies that the project uses.
- Speak with/join  communities and meetups that uses the same 
technology. People like to share stuff and ideas are always welcome.
- Create issues about what is needed, even for small things.
- Document. Document. Document. It’s nice when people can catch up after 
they lost something or join later the team.
- It’s helpful in case of regular meetings to use fixed days and hours.

### Rules of cooperation
- Try not to schedule events and meeting on same date with another event 
or meeting.
- Be responsible about using the tools
- Be responsible to community
- Avoid conflicts with lambdaspace services (like network and power). 
- Please keep the space clean.
